## What is ddev-python2?

This repository allows you to install [legacy Python2](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) inside `ddev-webserver` in a DDEV project.

This is only required if your `npm` uses Python2 to build its dependencies.

## Installation

For DDEV v1.23.5 or above run

```sh
ddev add-on get stasadev/ddev-python2
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```sh
ddev get stasadev/ddev-python2
```

Then restart your project

```sh
ddev restart
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run Python2:

- `python2.7` (installed at `/usr/bin/python2.7`)
- `python` (symlink to `python2.7` installed at `/usr/local/bin/python`)

This add-on also adds packages that are normally required for `npm` build, see [config.python2.yaml](./config.python2.yaml). Remove or replace the contents of this file if you only need Python2.
